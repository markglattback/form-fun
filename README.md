This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Introduction

This is a side project inspired by a technical test, built to display a form with custom input components and both client / server-side validation.

The objectives of this project are to produce a secure form, with good UI and UX, whilst having fun with some animations along the way.

This is still a WIP.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
